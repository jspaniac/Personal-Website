		<div class="info">Janurary 2020 - Present</div>
		
		<div class="desc"> Since winter quarter of his freshman year, Joe has been a Teaching Assistant for the University of Washington's 14X series, which introduces Java materials starting at “Hello World” and ending with basic data structures and class design. As as teaching assistant he is responsible for leading weekly review sessions for small groups of 20-25 students, grading assignments, and providing one-on-one help to students.

	  	<div class="title"><strong>Web Applications</strong></div>
		<div class="info">March 2020 - August 2020</div>
		
		<div class="desc"> For this project, Joe worked with a team to develop a variety of interactive web applications that were used in the Autumn 2020 offering of CSE 143. On the technical side, Google's AMP framework was used to develop the frontend, while a Java Sun HTTP server was used for the backend. Additionally, Joe helped lead a presentation at <a target = "_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04671">SIGCSE</a> to share the developement process and encourage other educators to make similar improvements to their courses.

		<div class="info">June 2020 - September 2020</div>
		
		<div class="desc"> Here, Joe managed a small group of student volunteers in the creation of an online adaptation for Crisis Connection's WTTFT booklet. This gave him a chance to gain familiarity with the React framework in rendering the application's frontend, while the backend was implemented with a Java Spark HTTP Server. The project was developed with modularity as a key focus, so the organization could easily make annual changes without much knowledge of programming languages.

		<div class="info">June 2020 - Present</div>
		
		<div class="desc"> Although Joe has been a member of the Q++—a club dedicated to promoting community between queer Allen School students and faculty—board practically since he discovered it his freshman year, he's been a co-chair of the organization since June, leading it through the pandemic quarters and whatever the 2021-2022 acadmic year has in store. His responsibilities as co-chair includes assigning officer duties, planning events, effectively communicating with a staff advisor, and running officer meetings. Under his co-leadership, membership grew to over 75 allen school students.

		<div class="info">August 2021 - Present</div>
		
		<div class="desc"> In his free time this summer, Joe spent his time developing this very website! It gave him a chance to try out Node.js and express instead of using a backend Java server like he's used to. He even drew the animation featured on the front page himself. Although it went live in September 2021, he keeps it up to date and is working on improving it today.
