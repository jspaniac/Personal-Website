	<p>Joe Spaniac (<a target="_blank" href="https://pronoun.is/he/him">he/him</a>) is a 3rd year student in the University of Washington's Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science and Engineering. Born and raised in Sammamish Washington, his journey into Computer Science started in his 11th grade, IB Computer Science SL class. Since then, he's been obsessed with all things CS, primarily the idea that through software he could meaningfully impact the world around him.
	</p>
	
	<p>Although he's working towards becoming a Software Engineer, he has a passion for teaching and as a result has spent a majority of his collegiate career teaching introductory Computer Science. Because of this, he's lately found himself exploring inclusive and equitable teaching in regards to CS Education. This has resulted in him taking additional responsibilities as a Grading Lead in recent offerings of CSE 143, with the interest of helping to better shape the course's relatively new, non-points-based grading system.
	</p>
	
	<p>He also is an active member of the Allen School community, having been on the board of Q++ (a club dedicated to building community among queer students of the Allen School) for the three years he's been at UW. As a co-chair, he helped lead the board through the difficulties of running social events during a global pandemic, growing membership to over 75 students as of the end of the 2020-2021 academic year.
	</p>
	
	<p>At the University of Washington, Joe has also explored a variety of his other interests including: Japanese, Spanish, lighting design, art, and video games. For more information regarding his resume other than what's written here, click the link below.
